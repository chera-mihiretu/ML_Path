# Machine Learning Project Path for Digit Recognition

# 1. Introduction to Machine Learning
 - Engaged with various resources to understand the basics of machine learning.
 - Completed introductory courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, or Udacity.

# 2. Environment Setup
 - Installed Python and necessary libraries like TensorFlow and Keras to create and train the model.

 3. Data Acquisition
 - Downloaded the MNIST dataset, a well-known dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

# 4. Data Preprocessing
#- Prepared the training data by reshaping the images and normalizing pixel values to improve model performance.
 - Converted labels into one-hot encoded format for classification.

# 5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development
### - Defined a CNN architecture that included:
 - Convolutional Layers: To automatically extract features from the images.
 - Max Pooling Layers: To reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
 - Flatten Layer: To convert the 2D matrices of features into a 1D vector for the fully connected layers.
 - Dense Layers: To output probabilities for each digit class (0-9) using softmax activation.

# 6. Model Training
 - Trained the CNN model using the prepared dataset, adjusting parameters such as batch size and epochs.

# 7. Model Evaluation
 - Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics to ensure effective recognition of handwritten digits.
 - 

# 8. GUI Development
 - Developed an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter for user interaction.

# 9. Real-time Prediction
 - Implemented a feature that enables real-time digit recognition based on user input from the GUI.



# 11. Future Work
 - Considered enhancements for the model, such as integrating additional datasets or exploring advanced techniques for improved accuracy.



# To Learn Machine Learning I Did This
```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```
Then Import Them
```python
import numpy as np
import panda as pd
```

After that I Learned the basics of numpy and pandas

# Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a digit recognition system using Machine Learning techniques. The system is trained to recognize hand-written digits from 0 to 9 using the **MNIST** dataset available on **Kaggle**.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Hand-written digit images are scaled and transformed for optimal model training.
- **Model Training**: Multiple algorithms are used for training (e.g., Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.), and performance is compared.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy and other metrics are evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the model.
- **Digit Prediction**: The model predicts the digit for new, unseen data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib kaggle
```
