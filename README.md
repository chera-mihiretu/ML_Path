# This is The Path I Took to learn Machine Learning
The first thing I had to do was to learn python. Since I know python pretty well I just Continued learning numpy.
This is how I learned numpy





# Digit Recognition using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a digit recognition system using Machine Learning techniques. The system is trained to recognize hand-written digits from 0 to 9 using the **MNIST** dataset available on **Kaggle**.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Hand-written digit images are scaled and transformed for optimal model training.
- **Model Training**: Multiple algorithms are used for training (e.g., Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, etc.), and performance is compared.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy and other metrics are evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the model.
- **Digit Prediction**: The model predicts the digit for new, unseen data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Kaggle

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib kaggle
```
